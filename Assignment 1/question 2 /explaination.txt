In question no.2 of this assignment

First I have saved the data in data.json file
Then wrote the code in question2.js file
where I started by making the user choose which function to run


Function1(detailsOfPokemon):for taking out the details of pokemon I have compared the input name with the names present in data,
then printed out all the details available.
For data in objects like prev_evolution and next_evolution I have created seperate functions to print those
(ie:getPreviousEvolution, getNextEvolution).


Function2(previousPokemonEvolution): To take out pokemon which have the input name in their next evolution in data.
I have smilply searched the input name in next_evolution data in json and then saved the names of pokemon 
which have that name in their next evolution in an array and then finally print it in alert box.

Function3(weaknessOfPokemon):To take out which all pokemon have that weakness, I have searched the weakness array data of every pokemon and then saved the name of pokemon in an array if they had the that weakness.
